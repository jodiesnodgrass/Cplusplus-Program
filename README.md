# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

For this project I set up a program to tell time in both 12 and 24 hour formats. The user is also shown a menu to chose 1 of 4 options. Option 1 adds one hour to the orginal input time. Option 2 adds one minute to the input time. Option 3 adds one second to the input time. Option 4 exits the program. For the 12 hour clock if the orginal input time is 11:59 AM and option one or two is chosen the clock shifts from AM to PM. 

# What did you do particularly well?

The output displayed once the code is ran shows very clearly. At the top side by side it shows the 12 hour and 24 hour clocks. Below the clocks is displayed and a menu with a boarder surrounding it making it clear that the user sees only the options for input 1-4.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

The code could be improved by making it more readable. With more in line comments individuals would have a better understanding of each function. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
